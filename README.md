- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh
- 👀 I’m interested in League of Legends, discord bots, programming, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cybersecurity at university for my major, and programming on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate at some point in the future, just on my own for now...
- 📫 How to reach me: "tymorek" on discord, please let me know that you're from github.
